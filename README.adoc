== PURPOSE:
Demonstrate how to pull and process social media feeds in FSW.

== OVERVIEW:
Red Hat's Fuse Service Works (FSW) product includes _components_ to communicate over many different types of transports.
Applications will often have a need to integrate with additional non-standard or proprietary protocols, however.
Subsequently, FSW allows for an extension mechanism that allows application developers to incorporate _components_ that are not included out-of-the-box.
This reference architecture makes use of this FSW extension mechanism to incorporate _components_ that communicate with various social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook.

For more details on the architecture, consult the link:doc/ref_arch.adoc[project documentation].
