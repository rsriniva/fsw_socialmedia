== PURPOSE:
The present reference architecture demonstrates how to pull social media feeds into FSW. The first implementation completed is the one for Twitter. 

== OVERVIEW:
FSW is started with a system property that defines the authorization and security parameters for an OAuth2 connection to Twitter and a keyword to listen for tweets. A component service is defined that uses a HTTP binding to connect and pull tweets. Once the tweets are pulled into FSW, a simple Java bean implementation logs them to stdout. 

For more details on the architecture, consult the link:doc/ref_arch.adoc[project documentation].
